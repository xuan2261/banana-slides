## ✨ Project Origin
Have you ever found yourself in this situation: a report is due tomorrow, but your PPT is still a blank canvas; your mind is full of brilliant ideas, yet all your passion is drained by tedious layout and design work?

We long for a way to quickly create professional and well-designed presentations. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the "speed" requirement, they still face several issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates, making it impossible to adjust styles flexibly.
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult.
- 3️⃣ Similar-looking outputs with heavy homogeneity.
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack specificity.
- 5️⃣ Fragmented text-image layouts with poor design aesthetics.

These shortcomings prevent traditional AI PPT generators from satisfying both the "speed" and "beauty" requirements. Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPT" are, in my view, far from truly being "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana🍌 model changed everything. I tried using 🍌pro for PPT page generation and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can render almost all text required by the prompt precisely and follow the style of reference images. So why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Applicable Scenarios

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero barrier to entry; no design experience required, reducing template-selection headaches.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Use AI-generated layouts and text-image combinations for design inspiration and rapid prototyping.
3. **Educators**: Convert teaching content into illustrated lesson plans quickly to improve classroom engagement.
4. **Students**: Swiftly complete assignment presentations, focusing energy on content rather than layout and aesthetics.
5. **Business Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions, adapting rapidly to multiple scenarios.

**FAQ**
1. **Does it support the Gemini API Key free tier?**
    * The free tier only supports text generation, not image generation.
2. **Receiving 503 error or Retry Error during generation**
    * Check Docker internal logs using the commands in the README to locate the detailed error. This is usually caused by incorrect model configuration.
3. **Why does the API Key in .env not take effect?**
    1. You need to restart the Docker container to apply changes after editing `.env`.
    2. If you configured it on the settings page, it will override the `.env` parameters. You can restore `.env` values via "Restore Default Settings."
4. **Garbled text in generated pages**
    * Try a higher output resolution (OpenAI format may not support resolution adjustment).
    * Ensure the specific text content to be rendered is included in the page description.
